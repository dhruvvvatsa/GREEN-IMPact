            <b>"Welcome to the Report on Drought"</b> This report, created by
            students from Lovely Professional University (LPU), explores the
            critical issue of drought and its impact on communities worldwide.
            The team—Dhruv Vatsa, Umesh Rana, and L. Priyatham Raj—analyzes the
            causes, effects, and challenges posed by drought, with a special
            focus on regions most affected. Drought threatens food security,
            water supply, and economic stability. Through this report, we aim to
            raise awareness about the importance of sustainable water management
            and the urgent need for global action.

                <strong>Drought</strong> is a recurring natural phenomenon with significant impacts on <em>agriculture</em>, water resources, and ecosystems. In <span style="color:#2ea44f;">India</span>, droughts are severe due to the country's dependence on agriculture. A drought is marked by prolonged low rainfall, leading to <u>water shortages</u> that affect farming, industry, and drinking water. These shortages often lead to social and economic crises. <br><br>
                India’s vulnerability to droughts has increased in recent years due to climatic changes, <em>overuse of groundwater</em>, and environmental degradation. The <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#2ea44f;">monsoon season</span> plays a vital role, but its irregularity, caused by climate change, worsens the problem. The two main phases of monsoon rainfall, the southwest (June to September) and the northeast (October to December), can be delayed, leading to severe droughts. For example, the 2016 drought was caused by a weak monsoon, leaving millions without sufficient water. <br><br>
                States like <strong>Maharashtra</strong>, <strong>Karnataka</strong>, and <strong>Telangana</strong> suffered massive crop losses and water shortages. The continuing lack of rainfall is a serious issue, with many areas facing droughts for extended periods.

                <strong>Drought</strong> is a natural disaster that severely impacts both the <em>environment</em> and human populations, particularly in arid regions. Globally, the frequency and intensity of droughts are increasing due to <span style="color:#2ea44f;"><strong>climate change</strong></span>, threatening ecosystems, economies, and agricultural productivity. In regions like the <u>United States</u>, <u>Africa</u>, and <u>Australia</u>, droughts have led to crop failures, water shortages, and economic downturns. The situation in <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#2ea44f;">India</span> is equally alarming, where droughts affect millions, especially in semi-arid areas like <em>Rajasthan</em>, <u>Gujarat</u>, and <em>Maharashtra</em>. The country’s dependence on monsoon rains for agriculture exacerbates the problem, and ineffective irrigation systems further limit water resources. <br><br>
                    Efforts to combat drought in <strong>India</strong> include promoting <em>water conservation</em>, modernizing irrigation infrastructure, and encouraging sustainable agricultural practices like <span style="color:#2ea44f;">rainwater harvesting</span>. On a global scale, solutions such as <strong>desalination</strong>, <em>wastewater recycling</em>, and improved <u>water management</u> are helping mitigate the effects of drought. However, long-term strategies are necessary to address the root causes, particularly <span style="font-weight: bold;">climate change</span>. The research shows that drought is a <span style="font-style:italic;">multifaceted crisis</span> requiring coordinated action from <span style="color:#2ea44f;">governments</span>, local communities, and international organizations. Sustainable water management and climate-conscious policies will be key in reducing the impacts of drought and securing the future of affected regions.

                <strong>Drought</strong> is a recurring environmental phenomenon that severely impacts agricultural productivity worldwide, and its effects are especially pronounced in regions highly dependent on rainfall. The bar graph presented above illustrates the varying intensity of drought's impact on agricultural yields in countries like <u>India</u>, the <em>United States</em>, <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#2ea44f;">Africa</span>, <u>Australia</u>, and <span>Brazil</span>. In <strong>India</strong>, where agriculture is largely reliant on the monsoon, droughts lead to significant crop failures and lower yields. These droughts not only affect food production but also disrupt the livelihoods of millions of farmers who depend on rain-fed agriculture. <br><br>
                    The <strong>United States</strong>, despite its technological advancements in irrigation, also suffers losses during severe drought conditions, particularly in states like <span style="font-style: italic;">California</span>, where agriculture is a key part of the economy. In <strong>Africa</strong>, where agricultural systems are less resilient, drought can have catastrophic consequences, exacerbating food insecurity and poverty. Similarly, <u>Australia</u> faces challenges with reduced agricultural output during prolonged drought periods, impacting both the economy and water resources. <br><br>
                    <span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Brazil</span>, with its vast agricultural lands, also experiences reductions in crop yields, especially in the central and northeastern regions, which rely heavily on seasonal rainfall. Overall, the data suggests that while some regions are better equipped to manage drought, it remains a critical issue that requires global attention and collaborative solutions to safeguard food security and sustainable agricultural practices.

                <strong>In conclusion,</strong> droughts continue to pose a <em>severe threat</em> to global agricultural systems and water resources, <span style="color:#2ea44f;">especially in countries like India</span>. While advancements in <u>technology</u> and water management strategies have helped mitigate some effects, much work remains to be done to prepare for future challenges. <br><br>
                <b>Key measures</b> include improving early warning systems, implementing sustainable farming practices, and <mark>investing in drought-resistant crops</mark>. It is crucial for governments, researchers, and communities to come together to reduce vulnerability and <i>build long-term resilience</i> to drought impacts. <br><br>
                As the <strong>global climate continues to change</strong>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">droughts are expected to increase in frequency</span>, making this issue even more urgent. A cooperative, <span style="font-style:italic;">global effort</span> will be essential in addressing the crisis effectively.
