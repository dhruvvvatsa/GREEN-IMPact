      <h1>Introduction to Drought in India</h1>

      <p>
        Drought is a recurring and devastating natural phenomenon that has
        significant consequences for agriculture, water resources, and
        ecosystems. In India, a country that depends heavily on agriculture for
        both its economy and food security, droughts are among the most common
        natural disasters, and their impacts are particularly severe.
      </p>

      <h2>Impact of the Monsoon</h2>
      <p>
        A drought is typically characterized by prolonged periods of low
        rainfall, leading to water shortages that affect agriculture, industry,
        and human consumption. In India, the consequences of drought can be
        far-reaching, not only causing food and water scarcity but also
        triggering social and economic crises. India’s vulnerability to droughts
        has increased in recent decades, largely due to changing climatic
        patterns, overexploitation of groundwater, and environmental
        degradation.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes of Drought</h2>
      <p>
        One of the key factors contributing to droughts in India is the monsoon
        season, which traditionally brings the majority of the country’s
        rainfall. The Indian Monsoon, however, is increasingly becoming erratic
        due to changing weather patterns and climate change. India typically
        receives rainfall during two monsoon phases: the southwest monsoon (June
        to September) and the northeast monsoon (October to December).
      </p>

      <h2>Human Activities and Drought</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to the natural variability in rainfall, human activities
        have also worsened the impact of droughts in India. Over-extraction of
        groundwater for agricultural irrigation, unchecked urbanization, and
        deforestation have compounded the country’s vulnerability to water
        scarcity. The over-extraction of groundwater, in particular, has left
        many aquifers depleted, making it difficult for regions to recover from
        droughts.
      </p>

      <h2>Effects on Agriculture and Society</h2>
      <p>
        Agriculture in India is particularly susceptible to drought due to its
        dependence on seasonal rains for irrigation. Around 60-70% of Indian
        agriculture is rainfed, making it extremely vulnerable to changes in
        monsoon patterns. As drought conditions persist, the country faces crop
        failures and food shortages. The inability of farmers to recover from
        repeated droughts has also led to a rise in farmer suicides, further
        highlighting the socio-economic toll of these environmental disasters.
      </p>

      <h2>Water Scarcity and Urban Crises</h2>
      <p>
        The consequences of droughts in India are not just confined to
        agriculture. As water resources dwindle, both rural and urban
        populations are left with limited access to drinking water. In some
        regions, people have to rely on tankers for water supply, and there are
        reports of water scarcity in cities like Chennai and Delhi.
      </p>

      <h2>Environmental and Ecological Impact</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to water and food insecurity, droughts in India also have
        ecological consequences. Prolonged drought leads to soil degradation,
        which reduces agricultural productivity and worsens food insecurity. The
        loss of vegetation due to water shortages results in increased
        desertification and reduced biodiversity.
      </p>

      <h2>Government Response and Measures</h2>
      <p>
        India’s response to droughts has included both short-term and long-term
        measures. The government often implements emergency relief measures such
        as distributing drinking water, providing fodder for livestock, and
        offering financial aid to farmers. In some cases, the government also
        attempts to mitigate the effects of drought by providing subsidies for
        rainwater harvesting, promoting water-efficient irrigation technologies
        like drip irrigation, and encouraging the restoration of degraded lands.
