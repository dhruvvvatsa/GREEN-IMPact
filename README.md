GREEN IMPact - A Study on Droughts
GREEN IMPact is a university project aimed at raising awareness about the causes, impacts, and solutions to droughts through an engaging website. Built with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript, this project presents information and visual elements to highlight the urgency of addressing droughts and their effects on the environment, agriculture, and communities.
